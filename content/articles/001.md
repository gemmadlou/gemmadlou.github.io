There are plenty of npm starters out there. And you could say I'm not helping by creating another one. 
 
I tried to work with an existing starter and got stuck. I didn't understand webpack all that well.

And if there's ever a reason to recreate the wheel, it's because you want to learn how to do things for yourself. In the process, I found creating a starter package with webpack is very simple.
 
## So what's different about this starter?
 
I wanted it to be as barbones as possible. It only needed to include 6 essential things: 
 
- the ability to watch and build files as I worked
- build a minified production JavaScript file  
- build a source map
- be ES6 and Babel ready 
- have testing out-the-box 
- always has an up-to-date distribution folder 
 
The last one was very important. I don't want to forget to bundle up my distribution files when I publish my package. Having this automated really helps.
 
## Getting started 
 
So how do we get it up and running. Go to the NPM Starter package repo to learn how:

### What about a package with styles? 
 
Well, I've created a package for that too:
