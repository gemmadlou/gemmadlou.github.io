title: Not another Npm package starter

There are plenty of npm starters out there. And you could say I'm not helping by creating yet another one. 
 
I tried to work with an existing starter and got stuck. The problem was I didn't understand webpack all that well.

And if there's ever a reason to recreate the wheel, it's because **you want to learn** how to do things for yourself. In the process, I found creating a starter package with webpack to be simple.
 
## So what's different about this starter?
 
It only needed to include 6 essential things: 
 
- watching and building files

- build a production ready library

- build a source maps out the box

- be ES6 and Babel ready

- testing setup

- an up-to-date distribution folder 
 
The last one was very important. Who wants to forget to bundle their distribution folder when they publish to npm? Automating this really helps.
 
## Getting started 
 
So how do we get it up and running. Go to the NPM Starter package repo to learn how:

### What about a package with styles? 
 
Well, I've created a package for that too:
